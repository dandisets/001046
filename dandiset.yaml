description: 'The B1 dataset contains unsorted spike times, audio recordings, and
  audio spectrograms from a zebra finch songbird during natural vocal behavior. Neural
  activity was recorded using Neuropixels probes from premotor and motor nuclei. We
  provide precomputed spectrograms for each session. The raw audio is also provided.


  In each datafile we provide the following as `acquisitions`: `tx` (threshold crossings
  at the full 30kHz resolution), `vocalizations` (the full sampling rate vocal recordings),
  `eval_mask_audio` (the mask for FALCON evaluation periods to be applied to the vocalizations).
  We also provide the following in the `trials` field: `spectrogram_times`, `spectrogram_frequencies`,
  `spectrogram_values`, and `spectrogram_eval_mask`. The spectrogram comprises the
  FALCON decoding target for this dataset.


  As part of the FALCON challenge, dataset files are released in three ways. The `held-in-calib`
  data includes many trials of data intended for calibration of decoders in the FALCON
  challenge. The `held-in-minival` data is a small subset of the `held-in-calib` data
  intended for FALCON models to validate submission format. Lastly, `held-out-calib`
  data are separate sessions of data from `held-in-calib`, but have much fewer trials,
  intended to be used for few-shot recalibration. Please bear in mind these factors
  if making use of this dataset for purposes outside of the FALCON Benchmark. Each
  dataset split is considered one "subject" by the DANDI repository; only data from
  one songbird is included.'
